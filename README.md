# ReverseSentence
I had a technical interview in which I was asked to create a method which will take a String and return it in reverse.  I was asked to write this code on a white board. After completing, I felt like I did a good job. It wasn't until the drive home that I realized my code would throw an OutOfBounds Exception. This repository contains a class that fixes this error.
